                <p>A sunny afternoon at the window, Mendel is standing tall on the kitchen counter, paws firmly planted, gazing at nothing. Or seemingly nothing — but Mendel knows better. They're tracking a fly that only they can see, plotting their jump trajectory, preparing to pounce at the exact moment the fly stops. This tabby doesn't miss. They never do.</p>

                <p>Mendel has somehow reached the highest shelf in the kitchen.

The look on their face is pure feline wisdom mixed with a hint of "I know what you did with that one toy..."</p>

But then they realized: it's a TINY POOL just for ME. The splash zone is activated. The expression is pure joy — Mendel has found their personal spa.</p>

The cushions have been perfectly molded to Mendel's body shape. The look on their face says: "This couch accepts me. I am home now."</p>

After determining it was safe (a small Amazon shipment), they claimed it immediately. Now it serves as Mendel's designated napping spot, treasure hoard, and strategic lookout point. The box door is slightly ajar — always ready for more discoveries.</p>

The paw rests gently on the keyboard as if to say "I could organize this better if you let me use the keyboard." But they don't actually use it — they just appreciate the feeling of power that comes with being in charge. Sometimes they bat at the cursor just to remind humans who's really boss around here.</p>
